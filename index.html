                        <p>Rogue - trained killers, melee combat experts. 
                          They specialize in close distance, dashing out small 
                          damage but with great agility. However, they have low health and stamina.

                        <p> Scholars of knowledge with insatiable thirst for power. They seek the arcane power of the void
                            , with great power comes great sacrifice. Their humanity slow descends into darkness.
                            They have high mana, low health, but they can deal massive damage with their spells, given that they possess sufficient mana.
                            Their stamina serves little to no purpose.

                        <h3>Demon Hunters</h3>
                        <p> Sworn enemies of demons. These warriors have given up their humanity to fight the darkness. 
                            Inside them lurks the desire for blood and disdain. They are, themselves, corrupted by the power of 
                            Kuhthama - the god of Death, who granted them the blood of demons. Demon hunters can then transform into 
                            the abominations they seek to destroy.

                        <p> Theses unholy creatures rise from the depths of hell with the sole purpose to devour all that is good.
                            Their power is unmatched, pulling from the darkest depths of Hell itself. They can cast spells and attack with great damage.
                            Their huge stamina allows them to attack multiple times.
